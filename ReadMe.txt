Welcome dear visitor,
The next project is a digital calculator project which was created using Html, Javascript, Css.
This is a simple Javascript project that calculates the values ​​entered by the user and performs a calculation using functions and presents them to the user, all with the help of a design that is accessible and intuitive to the user.
I hope you will be impressed by my project and with any questions do not hesitate to contact me through my portfolio website.
